Sound Search Link for Google Play Musicâ„¢
========================================

This repository contains the code for a small "install and forget" extension
which adds a link to the otherwise hidden Sound Search Playlist to your Google
Play Music interface.

If you're just interested in using the extension, head to the [Chrome Web Store
to install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cfjpgcchnapnhnlcnblkmfncnfnchlgf).

Permissions:

- **Read and change your data on play.google.com:** The extension injects a
  small script in order to programmatically add the Sound Search Playlist link.
  No other data is being read or modified (feel free to verify with the
  extension's source code).

Disclaimer: The extension might stop working at any time if Google decides to
change their markup for the Play Music interface.
